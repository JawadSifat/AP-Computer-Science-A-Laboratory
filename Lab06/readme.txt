PLEASE REMEMBER NOT TO INCLUDE YOUR NAME (OR LATER IN THE COURSE, YOUR
PARTNER'S NAME) ANYWHERE IN THIS SUBMISSION.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe your artistic creation, and how you went about writing a
 *  program to produce it. If you found information about a fractal
 *  from somewhere (like our book, the booksite, or another offline or
 *  online source) cite it here. 
 **********************************************************************/
 My artistic creation was my goal of representing pure abstract off-key chaos.
 I wanted the program to be random each time you run it but still have discernable patterns
 in it. When the recursion ends I wrote Caesar's refrain in a random position, just a pure
 arthouse thing. 



/**********************************************************************
 *  To get full credit on your Art.java, you need to have at least 3
 *  functions, including main(). Please list these functions below: 
 **********************************************************************/

 1. public static void main(String[] args)
 2. private static void drawJava(double[] x, double[] y){
 3. private static void drawMain(int iterations, double[] x, double[] y){



/**********************************************************************
 *  To get full credit on your Art.java, you need to have used at least
 *  two of the criteria below. Please put an 'X' in the checkbox of the
 *   criteria that your submission fulfills, for instance:
 *     [ ] this is an unchecked criteria
 *     [X] this is a checked criteria
 **********************************************************************/
 
    [ X ] call one or more Transform2D method

    [ ] use different parameters than our examples: f(n, x, y, size)

    [X ] use different StdDraw methods than in examples (e.g.,
        ellipses, arcs, text)

    [X ] number of recursive calls not constant per level (e.g.,
        conditional recursion)

    [ ] mutually recursive methods

    [ ] multiple recursive methods

    [ ] doesn't always recur from level n to level n-1

    [ X ] draw between recursive calls, not just before/after all
        recursive calls

    [ X ] use recursive level for secondary purpose (e.g., level
        dictates color)


/**********************************************************************
 *  Please check the following box if you do not want your Art to be
 *  shared (anonymously) with the rest of the class.
 **********************************************************************/

    [ X ] I do *NOT* want my art to be shared with the class


/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you receive help from classmates, past COS 126 students, or
 *  anyone else? If so, please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA"
 *  or "Office hours on Thursday" is ok if you don't know their name.)
 **********************************************************************/

no.




/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/

no.

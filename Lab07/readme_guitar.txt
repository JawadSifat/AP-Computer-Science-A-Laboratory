    Jokes aside, classes are simply blueprints for objects that allow users
    to commuicate with data and programs in a meaningful way. Having a seperate
    class for RingBuffer makes sense as it is an important object datatype that
    serves as a the basis for GuitarString.

 Java StdAudio doesn't work with my kubuntu laptop or with my MacOS, I haven't
 tracked down the issue yet but it was really annoying as it set back my progress
 a lot. My ZorinOS install on my desktop works fine so I'm wondering if it's with
 my JDK or audio controls. 

 Also Java itself is a problem >:(

 When this project was working, I really did enjoy it, I'm really sorry for 
 not being able to submit this on time and I'm grateful for the time extention and
 leniency you've shown.
